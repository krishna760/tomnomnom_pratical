This project demonstrates a DOM-based postMessage vulnerability using a simple HTML interface and an interaction with a known insecure endpoint hosted on Google's Public Firing Range.

## Components:  
Main HTML Page (index.html):  
When clicked on clickme button, it dynamically loads an insecure iframe and sends a postMessage to it containing a JavaScript payload.
The JavaScript file postmessageBug.js contains the onClickEvent() function that handles this logic.

## Target Iframe:  
It Loads the vulnerable page: https://public-firing-range.appspot.com/dom/toxicdom/postMessage/complexMessageDocumentWriteEval
Listens for postMessage events and executes the provided payload using eval() â€” which allows for remote code execution via the postMessage.

## Problems in code:  
missing msg.origin validation
missing X-Frame-Options which prevent webpage loadding inside iframe
missing best practice of using Access-Control-Allow-Origin which prevent read response from untrusted origin
Content-Security-Policy	 could mitigate eval, inline-script, and other XSS vectors.
Use sanitizer like DOMPurify
dont use eval

Lesson learned:    
This demonstrates how insecure use of postMessage and eval in the target iframe can lead to JavaScript execution in the context of that origin (document.domain).
